# AI-Driven Healthcare Diagnosis System

## Overview
The AI-Driven Healthcare Diagnosis System is an innovative project designed to revolutionize the healthcare industry by providing personalized, symptom-based diagnosis and actionable recommendations. This system integrates advanced AI technologies to enhance diagnostic accuracy, improve accessibility, and empower users with personalized healthcare insights.

## Features
- **Symptom-Based Diagnosis**: Provides accurate diagnoses based on user-inputted symptoms, age, and gender.
- **Personalized Treatment Recommendations**: Offers home remedies, medication details, and surgical intervention suggestions where necessary.
- **Lab Report Analysis**: Analyzes uploaded lab reports and highlights key parameters.
- **Prescription Detection and Explanation**: Detects and interprets prescriptions to provide clear instructions and information.

## Techn Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python for core development.
- **Language Model**: Fine-tuned Llama 3.1 with Unsloth techniques for optimized performance.
- **AI Framework**: LoRA-based fine-tuning for domain-specific healthcare tasks.
- **Backend API**: Gemini API for lab report and prescription analysis.

## Project Architecture
1. **Input Layer**: Collects user symptoms, age, gender, lab reports, and prescriptions.
2. **Processing Layer**: Uses AI models for:
   - Symptom analysis and disease prediction.
   - Lab report parameter highlighting.
   - Prescription interpretation and medication guidance.
3. **Output Layer**: Provides diagnoses, detailed recommendations, and actionable insights.
